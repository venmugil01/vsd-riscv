# vsd_SquadronMini-internship
The VSDSquadron Mini-Internship is a hands-on journey into VLSI chip design and the RISC-V architecture using open-source tools. It involves working with the compact VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board, which features a 32-bit RISC-V core, 16KB of flash memory, 2KB of SRAM, and operates at 24MHz. With 15 GPIO pins and support for I2C, SPI, and USART communication protocols, it provides the perfect platform to explore hardware interfacing and build real-time embedded projects while gaining a deeper understanding of the RISC-V ecosystem.
